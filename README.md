# appignition

This site is built using a very basic Bootstrap 4 template I created for savedit.com, except for the blog.
I built the blog based on the MEAN blog tutorial at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_1-Kge54K4
During the process of building it, I changed it to pull in the following libraries:
+ Bootstrap 4.0.0 alpha 6
+ JQuery 3.1.1
+ Angular 1.6.4

For my next blog development project, I will take this and:
+ Upgrade to latest stable version of Angular 4
+ Change the database to DynamoDB
